### PayPal Setup
Check out this tutorial on how to setup PayPal

#### Step 1: Create a PayPal Developer Account

- Sign up for a developer account:
- Go to the PayPal Developer Portal.

If you don’t have a PayPal account, click on Sign Up and create an account. If you already have one, just Log In.

#### Step 2: Create a New App (for Client ID and Secret)

- Once logged in, on the Developer Dashboard, click on the Dashboard link in the top-right corner.
- Under My Apps & Credentials, go to the REST API Apps section.
- Click on the Create App button.
- In the next step, you'll be prompted to:
    - Name your app (for example, "My PayPal App").
    - Select either Sandbox or Live mode, depending on whether you're testing or launching in production.
    - Click Create App.

#### Step 3: Obtain Client ID and Secret

- After creating your app, you’ll be taken to the App Details page. Client ID and Secret are displayed here:
    - Client ID: This is used to identify your PayPal integration.
    - Client Secret: This is used along with the Client ID to authenticate API requests.

Both are displayed under the Sandbox and Live environments. Choose the appropriate environment based on your needs. Please note that live is represented by production in Swiftchats setup under mode.

<Note>
Sandbox is used for testing.
Live is used for production after your app is ready to go live.
Copy your Client ID and Secret for future use in your application's configuration.
</Note>

#### Step 4: Create a Webhook

To receive notifications (like payment events) from PayPal, you need to set up a Webhook.

- On the same App Details page where you obtained the Client ID and Secret, scroll down to the Webhook section.
- Click on Add Webhook.
- In the URL field, enter the URL of your webhook endpoint. This is the endpoint in your application where PayPal will send event notifications (e.g., `https://yourapp.com/webhook/paypal`).
- Under Event types, select all events.
- Click Save.

#### Step 5: Testing (Optional)

Use Sandbox mode for testing purposes:
You can use the Sandbox Client ID and Secret to test your integration without real money.
PayPal provides Sandbox test accounts to simulate real payments. You can create buyer and seller test accounts in the Sandbox > Accounts section of the Developer Dashboard.
