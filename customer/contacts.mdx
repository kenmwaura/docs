The contacts module is designed to manage all contact-related operations efficiently. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and star contacts. Additionally, it supports bulk import and export of contacts, making it easier to handle large contact lists.

## Bulk Import
Easily import multiple contacts at once using CSV or Excel files. This feature maps file columns to contact fields, simplifying the import process.

### Mapping to columns
- First name `Required`
- Last name
- Phone `Required` `Start with country code`
- Email
- Group name

<Info>
    If the group name does not exist then it will be added automatically.

## Bulk Export
