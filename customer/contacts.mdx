The **Contacts** module is designed to help you efficiently manage all contact-related operations. It enables users to add, edit, delete, and star contacts, along with powerful tools for bulk import and export—ideal for handling large contact lists.

<Warning>
**Note:** The number of contacts a user can add is limited based on their subscription plan.  
For trial accounts, you can configure the contact limit by navigating to:  
**Settings > Subscription Settings** & under Trial Period Limits change the Contacts Limit
</Warning>

## Bulk Import
Quickly import multiple contacts at once using a CSV or Excel file. During the import process, you’ll be able to map your file's columns to the appropriate contact fields, ensuring accurate data entry.

### Required Column Mapping
- **First name** *(Required)*
- **Last name**
- **Phone** *(Required)* — Must start with the country code  
- **Email**
- **Group name**

<Info>
If a group name does not already exist, it will be created automatically.  
To assign a contact to multiple groups, separate the group names in the same cell using a pipe symbol (`|`).  
**Example:** `Group 1 | Group 2`
</Info>

### Import Rules & Validation

- Contacts that are **duplicates** of existing contacts **will not be added**. This includes duplicates found **within the uploaded file**.  
- Contacts with **incorrectly formatted phone numbers** (e.g., missing country code) **will be skipped** during import.

## Bulk Export
Export your entire contact list or selected contacts to an Excel file for backup, reporting, or integration with other systems.

## Important Items To Note

- If you **delete a contact** and later **re-add it**, you will **not be able to access previous chat history** associated with that contact. Once deleted, the link to past conversations is permanently removed.
