    <Accordion title="Why can't I send messages using my WhatsApp test number?">
        If you're using a test WhatsApp number provided by Meta, you'll need to whitelist the phone numbers you want to send messages to. To do this, follow these steps:

        - Log in to the Meta for Developers portal and go to your app.
        - Navigate to `WhatsApp > API Setup`.
        - Under `Send and receive messages`, select the `To` field and choose `Manage phone number list`.
        - You can add any valid WhatsApp number as a recipient. The recipient number will receive a confirmation code in WhatsApp that can be used to verify the number.
        - Once you verify the recipient number, it should now be selected in the To field. Repeat this process if you’d like to add another recipient, up to 5 in total.

        Remember, messages can only be sent to the whitelisted numbers until you switch to a production number.
