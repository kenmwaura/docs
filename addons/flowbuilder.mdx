## Overview

The **Flow Builder Automation Module** allows you to design, manage, and automate customer interaction workflows using a no-code, drag-and-drop interface inside Swiftchats.

## How It Works

The Flow Builder works using **nodes** and **triggers**. You can create a conversation flow by connecting blocks such as:

### Available Nodes

- **Text Message**  
  Send a simple WhatsApp text message to your contact.

- **Media Files**  
  Share images, videos, or documents as part of your flow.

- **Interactive Buttons**  
  Guide the user’s journey with button-based quick replies.

- **Interactive Lists**  
  Present structured multiple-choice options that are tap-friendly.

### Triggering a Flow

You can start a flow based on the following trigger types:

- **Keyword Match**  
  Automatically launch a flow when a user sends a specific word or phrase.

- **Contact Opt-in**  
  Automatically trigger a welcome flow when a new contact subscribes.

## Use Cases

- Lead qualification bots
- FAQs and instant support flows
- Booking or order automation
- Upsell/cross-sell messaging based on responses

## Troubleshooting

If your flows are not triggering:

- Ensure you’ve assigned a **trigger** to the flow (e.g., keyword or contact opt-in)
- Check if the **flow is active**
- Inspect logs under `storage/logs` for any errors in webhook or variable processing
