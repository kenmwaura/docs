## 1. How to setup AI Assistant (Admin section)

## 2. How to setup AI Assistant (Customer section)
- Go to `Automation > AI Reply Assistant`
- Enable AI Reply and add the following Open AI settings i.e. `API Key`, `model`, `max tokens`, `temperature`.
    <Note>
        - API Key: This is your API key from OpenAI, which allows you to access their services.
        - Model: Specify the AI model you want to use for generating responses e.g. gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct or gpt-3.5-turbo
        - Max Tokens: Set the maximum number of tokens (words and characters) the AI can generate in a single response e.g. 150 (A typical range is between 50 and 150)
        - Temperature: This controls the creativity of the responses. Lower values (e.g., 0.2) make the output more focused and deterministic, while higher values (e.g., 0.8) make it more creative and random. e.g. 0.7
