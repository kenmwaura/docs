### Overview 
Webhooks allow your application to receive real-time updates when specific events occur within our system. By providing a webhook URL and subscribing to events, your server will receive HTTP POST requests containing relevant event data.

#### Importance of Webhooks & Integrations

Webhooks are crucial for automating workflows and integrating different applications in real time. Here are some ways they can be used:

- Automated Notifications: Receive instant alerts when a message is received, sent, or updated.
- CRM Integration: Sync contacts, messages, and groups with customer relationship management (CRM) systems.
- Data Logging & Analytics: Store and analyze event data for insights and reporting.
- Third-Party Services: Connect with external applications such as Slack, Zapier, or custom APIs to enhance functionality.

By leveraging webhooks, businesses can streamline operations, improve efficiency, and create seamless cross-application workflows.


### Setting Up a Webhook
To set up a webhook, follow these steps:

1. Enable the Webhooks module by <a href="https://codecanyon.net/item/whatsapp-webhooks-swiftchats-module/55361925">purchasing</a> and activating it from the `Addons` section in the admin account.
2. After activation, go to the user account, navigate to `Developer Tools`, and select `Webhook`.
3. Click on `Add Webhook`, enter your webhook URL (must be a publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint), and choose the events you want to subscribe to.

Save your settings.

### Webhook Request Format

When an event occurs, our system sends an HTTP POST request to your specified webhook URL. The request contains a JSON payload with the following structure:

```
{
  "event": "event.name",
  "data": {}
}
```

#### Example Payload

`message.received`

```
[
  {
    "event": "message.received",
    "data": {
      "value": {
        "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
        "metadata": {
          "display_phone_number": "19680825846",
          "phone_number_id": "363351553535621"
        },
        "contacts": [

            "wa_id": "+19680825846"
          }
        ],
        "messages": [

          }
        ]
      },
