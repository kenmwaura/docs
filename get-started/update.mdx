<Warning>
    ### Important Info For Updates
    - Ensure that you are using **PHP v8.2**
    - Ensure that you have enabled the `imagick` extension in your server (If not, you might experience error 500)
    - If you're performing a manual update by replacing files, make sure you're upgrading from the **immediately preceding version**. If you've skipped previous updates, you must use the **automated update** instead.
</Warning>

<Info>
    ### Please perform a complete backup before updating
    - Before starting the update, make sure that you have backed up your <u>files</u> and <u>database</u> so that you can revert in case of any issues.
    - Any changes made to system files will be overwritten during an update. It's recommended to use additional files or a separate module for custom modifications.
</Info>

### Manual Update Process

1. Upload the contents of the `update` folder to your server’s `public_html` or domain root directory where the project has been installed.  
2. Visit your domain or subdomain — this should redirect you to the **update page**.  
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the update.

---

### Automatic Update Process

To update your system automatically:

1. Log in to the **Admin Panel**.
2. Go to **Settings**.
3. At the bottom-right of the settings menu, click **“Update”**.
4. Click **“Check for Update”**. If an update is available, click **“Apply Update”**.
5. Wait for the update process to complete.

### When Automatic Updates Fail

There are several reasons why the automatic update might fail. Below are the common scenarios and how to resolve them.

---

### 1. Insufficient Folder Permissions

**Symptoms:**

- The update button does nothing.
- The update stalls or fails silently.
- Files are not downloaded or replaced.

**Cause:**  
Your server does not have sufficient **write permissions** for the update process to download, extract, and overwrite necessary files.

**Solution:**

Make sure your server has correct file ownership and permissions:

```
chmod -R 755 /path/to/your/project
chown -R yourusername:www-data /path/to/your/project
```

> **Note:** Replace `/path/to/your/project`, `yourusername`, and `www-data` with actual values used in your server.

---

### 2. Server Configuration Limits

**Symptoms:**

- Timeout errors  
- Incomplete updates  
- "Blank screen" after update  

**Required PHP Settings:**

```
max_execution_time = 300
memory_limit = 256M
upload_max_filesize = 20M
post_max_size = 20M
```

You can adjust these values in your `.htaccess`, `php.ini`, or via your hosting panel — depending on your environment.

---

### 3. File Ownership Issues

**Symptoms:**

- Permission denied errors in logs  
- Only some files are updated  
- Inconsistent behavior after update  

**Solution:**

Make sure your project files are owned by the correct server user:

```
sudo chown -R youruser:www-data /path/to/your/project
sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/your/project
```

> Replace `/path/to/your/project`, `youruser`, and `www-data` with the actual values used on your server or hosting environment.

---

### 4. Debug Using Local Mode

If the update is stuck or unresponsive for more than 3 minutes:

1. Open the `.env` file in your project’s root folder.
2. Change:

```
APP_ENV=production
```

To:

```
APP_ENV=local
```

3. Retry the update.  
4. After the update, revert back to:

```
APP_ENV=production
```

> **Caution:** Use local mode only temporarily. Leaving it active in production can expose sensitive debugging information.

---

### 5. No Response or Nothing Happens

Open your browser **Developer Tools (F12)** → Network tab → Retry the update. Look for:

- CSRF token errors
- Session expiration
- Network request failures

Also check Laravel logs for errors:

```
storage/logs/laravel.log
```

### FAQs

<Accordion title="The update takes more than 3 minutes to complete.">
1. Open the `.env` file on your server (typically inside `public_html`).  
2. Change `APP_ENV=production` to `APP_ENV=local`.  
3. Retry the update process from the Admin Panel.  
4. After a successful update, revert it back to `production`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I skip multiple versions when updating manually?">
No. Manual updates are meant to go from one version to the next sequentially.  
If you've skipped earlier versions, use the **automatic update** instead to ensure all necessary changes are applied in order.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where can I check for update errors?">
You can find update-related errors in the Laravel log file:

```
storage/logs/laravel.log
```

Use this to identify:
- File permission issues
- Server exceptions
- Validation errors
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I make sure the update succeeded?">
Once the update is complete:
- The version number should be updated in the admin panel  
- New features or UI changes (if applicable) should be visible  
- Check the Laravel log file to confirm no errors occurred
</Accordion>

### Still Stuck?

If the update continues to fail:

Confirm that:
- File permissions and PHP settings are correct
- Your `.env` file is properly configured
- You’ve cleared your application cache

```
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```
