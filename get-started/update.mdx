    ### Important Info For Updates
    - Ensure that you are using php v8.2
    - Ensure that you have enabled `imagick` extension in your server (If not you might experience error 500). 
    - If you're performing a manual update by replacing files, make sure you're upgrading from the immediately preceding version. If you've skipped previous updates, you must use the automated update instead.

    ### Please perform a complete backup before updating
    - Before starting the update, make sure that you have backed up your <u>files</u> and <u>database</u> so that you can be able to revert back to them if you face any issues.
    - Any changes made to Swiftchats files will be overwritten during an update. It's recommended to use additional files for custom modifications.
