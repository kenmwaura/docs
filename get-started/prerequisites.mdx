<Warning>
  If you are not using Embedded Signup, your customers are the ones who will have to setup their own Cloud API (Business verification is not a must).
</Warning>

If you intend to use Embedded signup, you need the following in order to be verified as a tech provider:
> Meta business verification <br />
> Meta access verification (You need to be able showcase your business use case)
> Permanent access token (You can use temporary token for testing purposes)

You will have to guide your customers on how to make payments to Meta:
> To do this, instruct them to go to the Business Settings panel in the Meta Business Suite, select their WABA, and click the Settings tab. There they can add a payment method.  <br />
> Business Settings URL: https://business.facebook.com/settings/whatsapp-business-accounts/ <br/>
> Permanent access token (You can use temporary token for testing purposes)

<Note>
